# Swagger Client Examples

These clients are generated from our [Swagger docs](http://PutSwaggerDocLink.here) for the Digital Mortgage Deed API. They are just simple implementations to get anyone onboarding up and running quickly.

### Clients

- [C# client](#c-client)

## C\# client

The C\# client was built using [Xamarin studios](https://xamarin.com/)

If you'd like to run the application, install [Xamarin studios](https://xamarin.com/) and follow these steps

1. Open Xamarin Studio

2. Go to ``` File ``` > ``` Open ```

3. The project solution file is: ``` ./v0.1/CSharpSwagger/CSharpSwagger.sln ``` of this repository

4. Once it loads all you need to do is hit the **play** button or use the shortcut ``` cmd + alt + enter ```

> NOTE: Our implementation of the swagger generated client is in ``` ./v0.1/CSharpSwagger/CSharpSwagger/program.cs ```
